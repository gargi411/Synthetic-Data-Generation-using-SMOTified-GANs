# Synthetic-Data-Generation-using-SMOTified-GANs
This project presents a hybrid data augmentation framework that integrates SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance financial fraud detection systems through realistic synthetic data generation. Fraudulent transactions are typically rare, leading to highly imbalanced datasets that cause machine learning models to favor non-fraudulent predictions. To address this challenge, the proposed approach combines the strengths of structured oversampling and deep generative modeling to create balanced, diverse, and realistic synthetic transaction records.

The workflow begins with data preprocessing, where categorical attributes are transformed using label encoding, and numerical features are normalized for model compatibility. Next, SMOTE is employed to mitigate class imbalance by interpolating between existing minority samples, generating new synthetic fraud instances that preserve the original data distribution. This not only expands the minority class but also prevents overfitting that can arise from simple duplication methods.

After balancing, the dataset is passed through a GAN-based augmentation phase. The GAN architecture comprises a generator that produces synthetic transactions and a discriminator that distinguishes between real and generated data. Through adversarial training over multiple epochs, both networks improve iteratively until the generator produces synthetic transactions that are nearly indistinguishable from real ones. This step refines the SMOTE-generated data, introducing non-linear and complex fraud patterns that traditional interpolation cannot capture.

Experimental results demonstrated that integrating SMOTE and GANs improves model generalization and fraud detection performance significantly. The F1-score increased from 0.82 to 0.90, reflecting a stronger balance between precision and recall. Feature importance analysis using a Random Forest classifier revealed that transaction amount, time of transaction, and transaction frequency are the most critical indicators of fraudulent behavior.

Overall, this project contributes a robust synthetic data generation pipeline that supports the development of more accurate and explainable fraud detection models. It provides a scalable solution for financial institutions and researchers seeking to overcome data imbalance and improve the detection of rare fraudulent events.
